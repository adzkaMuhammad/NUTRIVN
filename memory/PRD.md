# NutriVane — PRD

## Problem statement
Rebuild the NutriVane Indonesian recipe/spice (bumbu) beta app from scratch, keeping the SAME
features as the live app but redesigning the UI to match the user's Figma (deep green, rounded
"bubble" cards, 3D-emoji moods, clean margins/alignment). Measuring-spice is merged into Scan as an
optional toggle. Each menu aggregates ~5-10 recipe sources to show AVERAGE spice amounts. Balanced
AI usage. Ready for ~100 users.

## Stack
React 19 + CRA (mobile-first shell, max-width ~460px, fixed bottom nav) · FastAPI · MongoDB (motor).
AI via Emergent Universal Key (emergentintegrations).

## Design (from user's Figma)
Palette: bg #f1f5ec, green #2f5d34 / deep #1f3f23, soft #e3efdc, accent terracotta #e3824f.
Fonts: Plus Jakarta Sans (UI) + Fraunces (display). Rounded cards, pill tabs, deep-green bottom nav.

## AI (balanced)
- Insight text: Gemini 3 Flash (gemini-3-flash-preview), cached in Mongo `insights`.
- Scan photo analysis: Gemini 3.1 Pro (gemini-3.1-pro-preview) — ONLY when a real photo is uploaded.
- Spice averaging, mood matching, recommendations: pure computation, NO AI.

## Implemented (2026-10-08)
- Pages: Beranda (home), Scan, Resep (list), Resep detail, Mood.
- Scan: benchmark menu picker + "Ukur & Analisis Bumbu" toggle (optional) + optional photo upload
  → result card with AI insight + spice meter (when toggle on). Scans logged to Mongo.
- Recipe detail: Spice Meter (avg per spice with % bars), AI "Insight rasa", source list.
- Dataset: 3 benchmark menus (Rendang, Sayur sop ayam, Nasi goreng) from Bumbu Nutrivane docx,
  each with averaged spices + recipe sources (data.py).
- No authentication (single demo profile "Asha") — matches original app.
- Tested: 21/21 backend pytest pass; frontend 100% (bottom nav, toggle, spice meter, AI, filters).

## Backlog / future
- P1: Real per-user accounts + real streak/plate analytics (currently demo counters).
- P1: Live camera capture (currently upload/benchmark preview in beta).
- P2: Expand dataset beyond 3 menus (drinks/dessert/tea exist in source doc).
- P2: Cache invalidation / dataset version in AI insight cache key.
- P2: Favourites persistence.
